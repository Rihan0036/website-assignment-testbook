                    <strong>Soya Bread;</strong>Every family in Ireland has its own recipe for soda bread, hand-written on flour-crusted note paper and wedged
                     in among the cookery books. Some like it sweet with a spoonful of honey, sugar or dried fruits. Others prefer sprinkled-in seeds, bran 
                     and oats for a health boost, or treacle and Guinness for the opposite effect. However, the basic ingredients don't change
                      (bicarbonate of soda and buttermilk form the raising agent, which is mixed in with flour) and nor does the way it's eaten: sliced and spread liberally with butter.

                    <strong>Irish Stew,</strong>One-pot cooking doesn't get much simpler than Irish stew, traditionally made with mutton, onions and potatoes 
                    (the addition of carrots can be a divisive issue). To avoid the stew being watery (a childhood horror for many of us), some recipes 
                    recommend adding pearl barley, a spoonful of roux or sliced potatoes, while others reduce the liquid by leaving the stew to simmer. 
                    These days, you're more likely to find Irish stew made with lamb (as the more flavourful mutton is harder to come by), 
                    with stock and herbs - such as thyme, parsley and bay leaves - adding depth of flavour.

                    <strong>Colcannon and Champ,</strong>Potatoes transformed the Irish diet when they were introduced from the New World in the 
                    late 16th century. Ireland's population boomed with this cheap and plentiful food source, but was later decimated when potato 
                    harvests were hit by blight in the 19th century. Potatoes are still a staple at most mealtimes, with traditional dishes remaining popular. 
                    Colcannon is a classic, comforting mash of potatoes, cabbage (or kale) and butter (or cream), 
                    flavoured with spring onions. Champ is a similar, mashed potato favourite, flavoured with spring onions, milk and butter.

                    <strong>Boxty,</strong>Potato dumpling, potato pancake and potato bread are all descriptors for boxty; some say the name originates from
                         the Irish phrase arán bocht tí, meaning 'poor-house bread'. The recipe calls for grated raw potato to be mixed with mashed potato and
                        then either: mixed with flour and salt and boiled before being sliced and fried in butter ('boxty dumplings'); added to a pancake-like 
                      batter before being fried ('boxty on the pan'); or added to a pancake-like batter before being baked in a loaf tin and then sliced 
                      and fried ('boxty in the oven'). Whichever way you choose, your boxty can be teamed with just about anything. 
                        Try it alongside bacon and eggs or smoked salmon and crème fraîche.
