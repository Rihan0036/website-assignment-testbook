                    <p><strong>Paul Henry (1876-1958),</strong> is an Irish painter who was born in Belfast, modern-day Northern Ireland. He first studied at the Belfast School of Art

                    <strong>Soya Bread;</strong>Every family in Ireland has its own recipe for soda bread, hand-written on flour-crusted note paper and wedged
                     in among the cookery books. Some like it sweet with a spoonful of honey, sugar or dried fruits. Others prefer sprinkled-in seeds, bran 
                     and oats for a health boost, or treacle and Guinness for the opposite effect. However, the basic ingredients don't change
                      (bicarbonate of soda and buttermilk form the raising agent, which is mixed in with flour) and nor does the way it's eaten: sliced and spread liberally with butter.

                    <strong>Irish Stew,</strong>One-pot cooking doesn't get much simpler than Irish stew, traditionally made with mutton, onions and potatoes 
                    (the addition of carrots can be a divisive issue). To avoid the stew being watery (a childhood horror for many of us), some recipes 
                    recommend adding pearl barley, a spoonful of roux or sliced potatoes, while others reduce the liquid by leaving the stew to simmer. 
                    These days, you're more likely to find Irish stew made with lamb (as the more flavourful mutton is harder to come by), 
                    with stock and herbs - such as thyme, parsley and bay leaves - adding depth of flavour.

                    <strong>Colcannon and Champ,</strong>Potatoes transformed the Irish diet when they were introduced from the New World in the 
                    late 16th century. Ireland's population boomed with this cheap and plentiful food source, but was later decimated when potato 
                    harvests were hit by blight in the 19th century. Potatoes are still a staple at most mealtimes, with traditional dishes remaining popular. 
                    Colcannon is a classic, comforting mash of potatoes, cabbage (or kale) and butter (or cream), 
                    flavoured with spring onions. Champ is a similar, mashed potato favourite, flavoured with spring onions, milk and butter.

                <li><img src="https://www.daringgourmet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Boxty-4.jpg" alt=""><p>
                    <strong>Boxty,</strong>Potato dumpling, potato pancake and potato bread are all descriptors for boxty; some say the name originates from
                         the Irish phrase arán bocht tí, meaning 'poor-house bread'. The recipe calls for grated raw potato to be mixed with mashed potato and
                        then either: mixed with flour and salt and boiled before being sliced and fried in butter ('boxty dumplings'); added to a pancake-like 
                      batter before being fried ('boxty on the pan'); or added to a pancake-like batter before being baked in a loaf tin and then sliced 
                      and fried ('boxty in the oven'). Whichever way you choose, your boxty can be teamed with just about anything. 
                        Try it alongside bacon and eggs or smoked salmon and crème fraîche.

                    <strong>Bunratty Castle,</strong> is now a very popular tourist attraction. The interior has been furnished by Lord Gort
                     with tapestries and artifacts from various eras in the castle's history. Some of the sights include the 'great hall', dungeons and four 
                     towers with spiral stairwells. Medieval-style banquets are held twice every evening in the great hall. The castle is also a popular 
                     attraction for wedding parties from the closest main city of Limerick hoping to make their special day even better with the beautiful surroundings.

                    <strong>Christ Church Cathedral,</strong> is located in the former heart of mediaeval Dublin, next to Wood Quay,
                     at the end of Dame Street . However a major dual carriage-way building scheme around it separated it from the original mediaeval street
                      pattern which once surrounded it, with it original architectural context (at the centre of a maze of small buildings and streets)
                       lost both by road-building and by the demolition of the older residential quarter at Wood Quay. As a result the cathedral now
                     appears dominant in isolation behind new civil offices along the quays, out of its original mediaeval context.

                    <strong>Dublin Castle,</strong>fulfilled a number of roles through its history. Originally built as a defensive 
                    fortification for the Norman city of Dublin, it later evolved into a royal residence, resided in by the Lord Lieutenant of
                     Ireland or Viceroy of Ireland, the representative of the monarch. The second in command in the Dublin Castle administration,
                      the Chief Secretary for Ireland, also had his offices there. Over the years parliament and law courts met at the castle
                      before moving to new purpose-built venues. It also served as a military garrison.

                <strong>Ireland,</strong>Ireland is an island nation on the westernmost edge of Europe. It is the continent's second largest
                 island (after Great Britain). The Republic of Ireland occupies 80 percent of this landmass,
                 while a large chunk of land in the north is part of the United Kingdom.

                Ireland is known for its wide expanses of lush, green fields. In fact, its nickname is the Emerald Isle.
                 But there are also large areas of rugged, rocky landscape. About 15,000 years ago, Ireland was completely covered by thick glaciers. 
                 The movement of these giant sheets of ice stripped the soil, leaving huge tracts of flat, limestone pavement.
                
                The midlands and west coast of Ireland are dotted with damp peat bogs, the soggy remains of dried-up ancient lakes left by the glaciers. 
                Ireland's highlands rise mainly in the southwest, often ending at sheer cliffs that plunge thousands of feet into the Atlantic Ocean.
